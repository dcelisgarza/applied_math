# Applied Maths

These are a collection of codes that I'm writing in preparation for graduate school in applied maths and scientific computing. I'm basing myself on codes from across the web and print, but modifying them to improve their performance and actually learn something.

So far I have used:

[https://www.wikipedia.org/](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

"Numerical Recipes in Fortran" by William H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling, and Brian P. Flannery.

"Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering (Studies in Nonlinearity)" by Steven H. Strogatz.
